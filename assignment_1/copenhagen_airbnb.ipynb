    "The results show clear performance differences across model classes. The Random Forest achieves the best overall fit (R² ≈ 0.58, lowest RMSE), closely followed by Gradient Boosting, indicating that nonlinear models are better suited to capture the complex relationships between listing characteristics, location, and price. These models benefit from their ability to model interactions and nonlinear effects, which are common in housing and short-term rental markets.\n",

    "The OLS model performs reasonably well as a baseline, explaining over half of the variance in log prices. This suggests that many price determinants have approximately linear effects. However, its performance is clearly dominated by the tree-based models, highlighting the limitations of purely linear assumptions.\n",

    "\n",
    "Both Random Forest and Gradient Boosting identify capacity and size-related variables as the dominant drivers of Airbnb prices. In both models, bedrooms and accommodates are the two most important features, indicating that larger listings with higher guest capacity command substantially higher prices. This aligns well with economic intuition and the pricing strategies of short-term rental markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The importance of room type (Private room) highlights a strong pricing discount relative to entire homes, reflecting segmentation between shared and fully private accommodations. This variable consistently ranks among the top features in both models, suggesting that categorical listing type is a key structural determinant of price.\n",
    "\n",
    "Location effects are captured through both geographic coordinates and neighborhood indicators. Latitude and longitude appear as important continuous spatial variables, while the specific neighborhood indicator (Indre By, the city center) further confirms a strong central-location premium. The presence of both spatial and categorical location variables among the top features indicates that price gradients are smooth across space but also jump discretely at neighborhood boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Booking constraints such as minimum and maximum nights contribute moderately to price formation. Listings with stricter minimum stays tend to have higher nightly prices, consistent with hosts targeting longer-stay or higher-value guests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Host characteristics play a smaller but non-negligible role. Host listings count appears in both models, suggesting that professional hosts price differently from casual hosts, potentially due to experience, portfolio strategies, or scale effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "A notable difference between the models is that Gradient Boosting assigns slightly more weight to amenities (e.g., dishwasher), whereas Random Forest emphasizes broader structural and spatial features. This reflects boosting’s strength in capturing smaller, additive effects, while Random Forest focuses more on dominant, high-variance predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, both models tell a consistent story: size, capacity, room type, and location are the primary determinants of Airbnb prices, with amenities and host characteristics playing secondary but meaningful roles.\n",

    "### A. Later Date (Same City)\n",
    "\n",
    "When applied to a later time period in the same city, model performance remains **stable and strong**, particularly for the nonlinear models. Random Forest achieves the best performance (R² ≈ 0.58), closely followed by Gradient Boosting. This indicates that the pricing relationships learned from the earlier quarter generalize well over time, despite potential seasonality, demand shifts, or supply changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear models (OLS, LASSO, Elastic Net) experience a modest drop in explanatory power compared to the training period. This suggests that while linear relationships remain relevant, they are less flexible in adapting to evolving market conditions. Overall, the results support **temporal validity** of the modeling approach, especially for tree-based methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Other City (Cross-City Transfer)\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance drops more noticeably when models are transferred to a different city, which is expected. Location-specific factors, market structure, and consumer preferences differ across cities, reducing direct transferability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The OLS model performs extremely poorly, indicating strong **model misspecification** when linear assumptions and city-specific coefficients are applied outside the original market. In contrast, LASSO, Elastic Net, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting all retain reasonable explanatory power (R² ≈ 0.35–0.40).\n",
    "\n",
    "Among these, **Gradient Boosting performs best**, followed closely by Random Forest. This suggests that nonlinear models are better able to generalize structural pricing patterns (e.g., size, capacity, room type) across markets, even when absolute price levels differ.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overall Validity Assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Temporal validity**: Strong — models, especially Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, generalize well to later periods within the same city.\n",
    "* **Geographic validity**: Moderate — performance declines across cities, but nonlinear models remain usable.\n",
    "* **Key insight**: Pricing models should ideally be **retrained or fine-tuned per city**, but tree-based models provide the most robust starting point for cross-market deployment.\n"
